Personal project - script that executes one or more deadman strategies after a specified time interval

**In Progress...**

### TODO:
- [ ] remove cryptography key logic -> should provide key not load/create from .env file
- [ ] create DeleteData class
- [ ] modify script to delete entire lib not just executable
